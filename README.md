# INDRA Plugin VATSIM

## Release version

In order to get everything to work in the release version along side the DLL file, there should be a file called "indra_saved_views.json"
an example of which is shown bellow:
`[
 {"button":"S","name":"View S","zoomNm":120,"centerLat":36.692194444444,"centerLon":3.2151111111111},
{"button":"0","name":"View 0","zoomNm":80,"centerLat":36.692194444444,"centerLon":3.2151111111111},
{"button":"1/2","name":"View 1/2","zoomNm":60,"centerLat":36.692194444444,"centerLon":3.2151111111111},
{"button":"1","name":"View 1","zoomNm":100,"centerLat":36.692194444444,"centerLon":3.2151111111111},
{"button":"3","name":"View 3","zoomNm":150,"centerLat":36.692194444444,"centerLon":3.2151111111111},
{"button":"5","name":"View 5","zoomNm":200,"centerLat":36.692194444444,"centerLon":3.2151111111111},
{"button":"8","name":"View 8","zoomNm":250,"centerLat":36.692194444444,"centerLon":3.2151111111111},
 {"button":"VIEW1","name":"View 1","zoomNm":120,"centerLat":36.692194444444,"centerLon":3.2151111111111},
{"button":"VIEW2","name":"View 2","zoomNm":300,"centerLat":36.692194444444,"centerLon":3.2151111111111}
]`

this defines the views each button will go to when they are clicked
